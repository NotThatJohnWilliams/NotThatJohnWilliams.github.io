My first Shiny App explores the demographics of food security in the United States as a whole.  It sources data from the "December 2020 Food Security Supplement" from the United States Census Bureau.  Users can explore numerical and graphical summaries of food security, fit prediction models, and view/download filtered subsets of the data.
