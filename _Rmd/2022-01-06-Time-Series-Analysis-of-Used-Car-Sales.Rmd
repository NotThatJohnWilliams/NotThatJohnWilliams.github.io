I had so much fun on this group project last semester. It was the culmination of my class in Time Series Analysis. Our goal in this project was to forecast retail sales of used car dealers in the United States.  We sourced the [used car sales data](http://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MRTSSM44112USN) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Loius ([FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org)). Using SAS, we fit several models to the data, both seasonal ARIMA and intervention models. Finally, we predicted used car sales for the next 12 months. It was a fascinating step into real-world time series analysis.

Take a look at the project here:
