’Tis the season to eat, drink, and be merry. In that spirit of
merriment, I asked this question: “Can you predict wine quality using
just the physical and chemical characteristics of the wine?”

Of course! Using machine learning, anyone can create predictive models
to answer just such a question. So During this holiday break, I did just
that. I practiced training linear regression models using `caret` with
the goal to predict wine quality using just its intrinsic physical and
chemical characteristics.

Grab a glass and review my vignette here: [Training Linear Regression
Models using
