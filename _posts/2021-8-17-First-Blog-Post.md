title: What is a Data Scientist?
---

In 2012, an article in the Harvard Business Review called a data scientist “the sexiest job of the 21st Century” for good reasons.  Individuals and enterprises are bombarded with overwhelming amounts of data every day. They need a superhero who can rescue them from drowning in terabytes of meaningless ones and zeros.  A data scientist can skillfully gleam insights from the depths of data, coaxing it to tell a story so that stakeholders can make smart, data-driven decisions.

Data scientists ingest mountains of data, transform it into something tidy, explore it using statistical analysis, select a prediction model, evaluate that model, and finally tell a story to a broader audience.  Their process melds statistics, software engineering, and art.  Statistics is the foundation of data science; data analytic software and machine learning algorithms are the tools; and communicating the insights is the art.  Practically, data scientists have knowledge of data analysis tools such as Python, SAS, and R; have experience in SQL database coding; can work with unstructured data; understand multiple analytical functions; and possess knowledge of machine learning.

While they both use statistical inference to answer real-world questions, data scientists differ somewhat from conventional statisticians.  Data scientists deal with massive raw data sets; statisticians work with traditional, small-scale data collections commonly sourced from designed experiments or observational surveys.  Data scientists create models that focus on making accurate predictions for their stakeholders; statisticians build and test models that address theoretical assumptions.  Data scientists compare different modeling techniques to create the best prediction model; statisticians work on improving a single model for the best fit.  Data scientists use machine learning to improve the model over time as new data becomes available; statisticians focus on quantifying uncertainty within the model.
