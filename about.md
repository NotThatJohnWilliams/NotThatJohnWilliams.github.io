Hello!  My name is John Williams!  After 15+ years as an [engaging, results-driven leader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwilliamsjcp/) within the retail industry, I'm currently in the middle of a career transition.  In 2020, I decided to make a bold move and continue my education, pursuing a Masters of Statistics at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/).  I expect to graduate in May 2022!  I'm excited and eager to find out where the next 20+ years of my career will take me!

While I'm not a talented composer like that other John Williams, I am a big fan of everything math, economics, science, sci-fi, and [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/)!  My favorite podcasts are [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/), [Make Me Smart](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/), [RadioLab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/projects/podcasts), and--most recently--[Not So Standard Deviations](https://nssdeviations.com/).  I don't have any pets or kids, but I do have several orchids that I've rescued from friends and family who just couldn't get them to flourish. Given the temperment of *phalaenopses*, I think they count as pets, right?

I love going on adventures across the globe any chance I get!  I've vacationed in 16 countries and hope to visit many more once things are back to normal.  But since globetrotting isn't an option right now, I spend most of my free time playing Minecraft.  It's just as fun as Legos without the agony of stepping on the blocks.  Ouch!
